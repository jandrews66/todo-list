# todo-list

Create a todo-list app. The user should be able to create projects or seperate lists of todos. The todos should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. 

The app logic should be seperated (i.e creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing priority etc) from the DOM-related stuff. Use separate modules.
